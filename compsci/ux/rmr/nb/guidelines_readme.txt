  * Feedback

  * Metaphors
    people learn quicker when app's virtual objects and actions are metaphors to familiar experiences. i.e. flick through pages like in books

    people - not apps - are in control.  the app should not make a decision.  find correct balance between enabling users and avoiding unwanted outcomes. For destructive actions make confirmations. Make it easy to cancel operations, even wehen they are already underway
