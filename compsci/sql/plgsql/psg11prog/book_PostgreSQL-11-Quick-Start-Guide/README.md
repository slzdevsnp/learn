## Naming conventions

Each chapter in the book has a corresponding folder within the repository. Each folder contains a set of files named after the chapter number and the listing in the chapter: as an example the listing 3 of chapter 2 is placed in the folder `Chapter02` with the name `Chapter02_Listing03.sql`, that is `Chapter02/Chapter02_Listing03.sql`.


## What is this book about?
PostgreSQL is a rock-solid, scalable, and safe enterprise-level relational database. With a broad range of features and stability, it is ever increasing in popularity.This book shows you how to take advantage of PostgreSQL 11 features for server-side programming. Server-side programming enables strong data encapsulation and coherence.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Explore data encapsulation
* Write stored procedures in different languages
* Interact with transactions from within a function
* Get to grips with triggers and rules
* Create and manage custom data types

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders, one per chapter, as for example `Chapter02`.

The code will look like the following:
```
ImgRes* new_ImgRes() {
  ImgRes* new_object = (ImgRes*) palloc( sizeof( ImgRes ) );
  new_object->h_px = 300;
  new_object->v_px = 300;
  new_object->dpi  = 96;
  return new_object;
}

char* to_string( ImgRes* object ){
```


Each source code file has a suffix that indicates the type of the file itself, mainly:
- `.sql` means the file contain SQL statement(s);
- `.perl` or `.plperl` means the file contains Perl 5 code;
- `.java` means the file contains Java source code;
- `.output` means the file contains text output of the execution of a SQL statement or another executable code.
