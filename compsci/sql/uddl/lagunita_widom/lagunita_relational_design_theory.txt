theory for relational database design


chap Overview
--------------
Functional dependencies => boyce-codd normal form BCNF
Multivalued dependencies => Fourth Normal Form 4NF


Apply(SSN, sNamee)  123 -> Ann
BCNF if A -> B then A is a key

Multivalued dependencies
SSN ->> cName 

e.g.
apply(ssn, sname)
apply(ssn, highSchool)


Design by decomposition
=======================
1. "mega" relations + properties of data
system decomposes based on properties
final set of relations satisfies normal form
    (no anomalies, no lost information)
functional dependencies => Boyce-codd normal form
multivaled dependencies => Fourth Normal Form

chap Functional dependencies
----------------------------

basic functional dependency definition:
for any t,u belonging to R (relationship)
t.A = u.A => t.B = u.B 
 then A -> B  (B is functionally dependent on A)

 Armstrong's axioms (to check)


chap Boyce-Codd Normal Form
----------------------------

a Relation R wth FDs is in BCNF if:
    for each \bar{A} -> B, \bar{A} is a key


a BCNF violation example (duplication of columns A, B)

| \Bar{A} |  B  | rest |
-----------------------
| a       |  b  |  r1  |
| a       |  b  |  r2  |


BCNF decomposition  algorithm

input : relation R + FDS for R 
output: decomposition of R into BCFNF relantionsh with lossless join 

algo:
    Compute keys for R using FDs
    Repeat until all relations in BCNF
    Decompose R' into R1(A,B) and R2(A,rest)
    Compute FDs for R1 and R2
    Compute keys for R1 and R2

Informally the Boyce-Codd normal form is expressed as “Each attribute must represent a fact about the key, the whole key, and nothing but the key.”


chap  Multivalued Dependencies and 4th Normal Form
--------------------------------------------------

4th normal form is stricter then BCNF (a subset of BCNF)

with no functional dependencies in the relation the key
is all attributes of the relation

4NF is a separation of independent attributes

multi-value dependencies = tuple generating dependencies

A multidetermines B

4NF def:
Relation R with MVDs is i 4NF if:
    for each nontrivial A ->> B, A is a key






in a  design we need a good decomposition
