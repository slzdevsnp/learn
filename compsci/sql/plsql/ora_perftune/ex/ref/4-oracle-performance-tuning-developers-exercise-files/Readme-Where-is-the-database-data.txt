Where is the database data?

In order to reduce redundancy in the download package, the sample data for the university data is provided just once, as part of the module 1 demo.  If you unzip the demos file for module 1, then you will find the data and instructions on how to import it into an Oracle database.  Also, if you are not familiar with the imp command, in module 1 there is a clip on how to import the data.
